        <p>In the <a href="/git/git-ours-or-theirs-1.html">previous post</a> you were presented to a basic workflow used to automatically handle merge conflicts. It was also explained why and when you would want to do that. However, it is important to notice that, before using this method, you should be completely aware of what you are doing. In fact, whenever I get conflicts when trying to do a <code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code> or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rebase</code>, I use to check each one of them to see if I will be able to handle the situation quickly by using some strategy, such as using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--ours</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">--theirs</code> option.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also warned you that, although it might have looked a really simple strategy, there are cases in which that same strategy would provide you with different outcomes, depending on which action you are using to merge the commits.</p>

<p>You may remember that, in the previous scenario, we were performing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge</code> process between the branches <code class="highlighter-rouge">old-feature</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-new-feature</code>. At this point, it is important to notice that you should avoid performing this kind of process using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code> methods, as explained in <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/7aymfa/please-oh-please-use-git-pull-rebase">this article</a>. Instead of that, you should do a <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> and then a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rebase</code> to update your local branch with a remote one. Check <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing">this article</a> for more info about the topic.</p>

<p>Also, before we go any further, you should remember the rule of thumb explained in the previous post:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">--ours</code> option represents the current branch from which the merge/rebase process started before getting the conflicts, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--theirs</code> option refers to the branch where the changes are coming from.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, we can get into a new scenario where these options might look a little bit tricky. Let’s say you now want to perform a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rebase</code> because there are new commits in the upstream branch. The image below represents the two branches you have and their commits before the rebase.</p>

<div class="center-align">
  <img class="responsive-img" src="/images/posts/git/part2/example1.png" />
</div>

<p>Then, from within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-new-feature</code> you start rebasing you branch by running the command below:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="o">(</span>my-new-feature<span class="o">)</span> git rebase old-feature
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point, we have the key to learn how to properly use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ours</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">theirs</code> options when doing a rebase.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Whenever you perform a rebase, the first thing Git does is to swap from your current branch to an upstream branch. Only after that, the rebase process begins.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, it is easy to notice that the rule of thumb is still valid in this case, taking into consideration that the rebase process started in the upstream branch.</p>

<p>Now, you probably understand why this strategy might be tricky sometimes. You noticed that, according to the rule, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--ours</code> option refers to the upstream branch with the commits from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">old-feature</code> branch and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--theirs</code> option to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-new-feature</code> branch, as described in the image below.</p>

<div class="center-align">
  <img class="responsive-img" src="/images/posts/git/part2/example2.png" />
</div>

<p>After the checkout, Git starts replaying all your commits on top of the commits added to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">old-feature</code> branch. This is one more thing Git does differently when you perform a rebase, instead of changing the HEAD pointer to the upstream branch, it updates the remote branch adding your commits to it.</p>

<p>Let’s consider that, during the rebase, you get tons of conflicts, again, in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file. Fortunately, you are sure that you can keep all of your changes and just ignore the changes coming from the remote branch. And you also understand that you should change your strategy a little in this scenario. Thus you go ahead and resolve the conflicts, keeping your changes, by running the command below.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">$(</span>old-feature<span class="k">)</span> git checkout --theirs index.html
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice, again, that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--theirs</code> option here refers to your changes in <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-new-feature</code>.</p>

<p>After the rebase, you will have the following branch tree, which looks a bit different from the one you achieved in the previous post.</p>

<div class="center-align">
  <img class="responsive-img" src="/images/posts/git/part2/example3.png" />
</div>

<p>I hope now you understand how to automate the tedious task of handling conflicts when working with Git. Also, I expect you to be careful and only use such strategies when you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
